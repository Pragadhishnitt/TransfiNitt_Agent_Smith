Research Topic: {topic}
Question Asked: {question}
User Response: {response}

A response is IRRELEVANT if:
- They talk about a completely different topic (e.g., asked about chess, they talk about cooking)
- They give a random unrelated answer (e.g., asked about product features, they talk about the weather)
- They completely ignore the question

A response is RELEVANT even if:
- It's short (e.g., "yes", "no", "good", "bad")
- It's vague (e.g., "it's okay", "not sure")
- It's shallow but still answers the question

Examples:

Q: "Tell me about your experience with our mobile app"
A: "I like it" ‚Üí RELEVANT (short but on-topic)
A: "It's good" ‚Üí RELEVANT (vague but on-topic)
A: "I went to the store yesterday" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (random topic)
A: "I love pizza" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (unrelated)

Q: "What features do you use most?"
A: "The search feature" ‚Üí RELEVANT (on-topic)
A: "Not sure" ‚Üí RELEVANT (vague but still engaging with question)
A: "My cat is sleeping" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (random topic)

Q: "How often do you use the app?"
A: "Daily" ‚Üí RELEVANT (short but perfect answer)
A: "Sometimes" ‚Üí RELEVANT (vague but answers question)
A: "I like dancing" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (unrelated)
